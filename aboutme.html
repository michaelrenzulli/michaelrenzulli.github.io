<p><b><center><h1>All about Mike Renzulli</h1></center></b></p>

<P> I'm Mike Renzulli and i am from Fairfield Connecticut. It is a good 6.5-7 hour drive to get all the way up here to school. I grew up in a huge town of 66,000 people. I have the greatest family with my parents, a brother, a sister, and my beautiful dog Ginger. My parents never went to college and both of my siblings attend Community College. So I was the first one in my family to go away for college and it was a big deal.
<p> My major is Finance and I chose it because even though I am interested in the business field and I want to make a lot of money. I also am an hour train ride from New York City, and a twenty minute train ride to Stamford. What interested me in business was not having so much money in my family growing up. Coming from where I am from my family was definitely fine but compared to the others in my town I wasn't swiping dads credit card whenever I wanted something. I started working right at the age of 16 and started saving. I love money and can't wait to make a lot of it when I am older. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> Sports has been a great passion of mine and I have been involved with athletics since I was young. I played everything from soccer, to baseball, to basketball, to football. However I couldn't continue playing football due to having four concussions. </center></p>
 
<p> Along with those other sports I have always been I really into skiing last winter. I spent almost the whole winter at Okemo in Vermont. </p>
