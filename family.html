<p><b><center><h1>Family</h1></center></b></p>
	
<p style="text-align: center"> I grew up in a family that could not have raised me better and I am so thankful for that. My parents may not have had the best jobs in the world but they worked their butts off for my siblings and I to make sure we had what we needed. I love them endlessly. Also, my grandparents were a big influence in my life. I was so granted to have both of my grandparents live in the same town as me. I know a lot of my friends have to go towns, maybe even states or countries away to see their grandparents. Any given day I can take ten minutes of time and show up to their house and have a nice lunch and just hangout with them. </center></p>
