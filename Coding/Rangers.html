<p><b><center><h1>Rangers</h1></center></b></p>
	
<p style="text-align: center"> Coming from Connecticut, and being an hour train ride from New York City, I grew up a huge New York Sports fan, especially the New York Rangers. Out of their 82 game season, I watch at least 65 of their games and attend as many as possible. Last year, during the 2016-2017 season, I went to 10 games with my buddies. Now being so far away, I am going to have to catch as many as possible whenever I am home on break or get the chance to go. They have the power to make my day amazing, or make me want to rip ones head off. Hopefully this year will be our year and we can win our first Stanley Cup since 1994! </center></p>
