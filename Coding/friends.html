<p><b><center><h1>My Friends</h1></center></b></p>
	
<p style="text-align: center"> Throughout my life, especially the transition from middle school to high school, I have been changing friend groups. The people I hung out with in middle school grew up to be the kids I didn't want to see myself becoming. I kind of just did whatever and then I finally found the group for me sophomore year. To this day they are some of my closest friends who I can talk to whenever I need to. Also some of the people I have already met up here at The University of Maine are now some of my other closest friends who I see being in my life forever. </center></p>
